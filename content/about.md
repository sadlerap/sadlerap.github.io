# Hey!

I'm Andy.  I'm a software developer, working in Go on my day job & in Rust in
my free time ðŸ¦€.

I've been ever-so-slowly getting into writing more, and this site will serve as
a dumping ground for my thoughts (though it's still under construction ðŸš§).

When I have more to say, expect it here.
